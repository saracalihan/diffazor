  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender
 the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
 of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass
 on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received
.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the
 source code.  And you must show
them these terms
so they
know their r
ights.
